An ACL rudimentary demo for medical systems management

Live at: https://hypercrates-900239d97135.herokuapp.com/

# Getting started

Fork and then clone this repo on a machine where you have docker and docker-compose installed,
then use the following commands:
    - `$ cd hypercrates/hyper`
    - `$ docker-compose up`

After installation you will need to apply migrations in order to set up the db:
   - `$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate`

And also create a superuser in order to access Django Admin at `/admin` (optional)
   - `$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate` - follow the instructions provided

It is necessary to load the fixture users.json as it provides groups for access rights.
   - `$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py loaddata users.json`

You can also load mock data into the db by doing:
   - `$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py loaddata data.json`
